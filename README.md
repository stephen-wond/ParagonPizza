# ParagonPizza

This oven program begins by requesting the user to input the amount of time (in seconds) that a pizza will take to cook in the oven.

The main window, although basic, allows the user to add new pizza orders to the cooker conveyor belt and also to keep track of the status of all orders.

The pizza oven has a capacity of 2 pizzas, so only 2 pizzas can be cooking at anyone time. 
Due to the nature of a conveyor belt type oven, if 2 pizzas are already cooking and a third one is added to the order list, then the third pizza will not begin cooking until the first pizza has made it to the end of the oven.
